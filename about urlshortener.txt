Project Overview
You can start by explaining the project's goal. Your URL shortener is a full-stack application that takes a long URL from a user, generates a short, unique code, and then redirects the user to the original URL when they access the shortened link.

Key Functionality: It demonstrates the core principles of web development: handling user input on the front end, processing that data on a server, and storing it in a database.

Goal: The project showcases your ability to build a complete, end-to-end web service.

Front-End: The User Interface
Your front end is a single HTML page that's embedded directly in the Python script. When you present this, you can explain that this is a simple but effective way to build a UI for a small application.

File: The front-end code is part of the url_shortener.py file, stored in the HTML_TEMPLATE variable.

Technologies:

HTML: Provides the structure of the page, including the form with the input field and the button.

CSS: The styling is embedded in a <style> tag and uses a modern, dark theme with a cyan accent. This makes the interface clean and easy to use.

Functionality: It provides a user-friendly way to input a long URL and displays the newly generated short URL in a clear, separate box.

Back-End: The Server and Logic
This is the core of your project. You can explain that the back end is responsible for all the "behind-the-scenes" work.

File: The back end is entirely within the url_shortener.py file.

Framework: You used Flask, a popular Python web framework. You can explain that Flask is a great choice for smaller projects because it's lightweight and easy to set up.

API Endpoints: Your server has two main endpoints:

@app.route('/'): This is the homepage. It handles both GET requests (to display the initial form) and POST requests (to receive the long URL from the user).

@app.route('/<short_code>'): This is the redirect endpoint. When a user visits a shortened URL, this function looks up the original URL in the database and sends the user there.

Database: You can explain that you used a simple, in-memory Python dictionary (url_database) to store the short code and long URL mapping. You could also mention that for a larger-scale application, you would replace this with a more persistent database like SQLite or MongoDB.

URL Generation: The generate_short_code() function creates a unique, six-character string for each URL, ensuring no two short links are the same.
